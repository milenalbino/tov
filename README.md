#tov
Solves the TOV equations and obtains the tidal deformability values for a given equation of state (EoS).

All you need is a file with the pressure and energy density values of your chosen EoS.
This file should have a header indicating 'pressure' and 'energy' for the pressure and energy density columns respectively.
The column separator must be a space (you can change it in the "sep" option on line 12).
An example of EoS is attached here ("example_eos.dat" - set II of arXiv:2106.12956).
